# sensitivity-analysis-of-technoeconomic-metrics
This project aims to analyze how various technical and economic factors influence the overall cost and economic viability of solar panel installations. A sensitivity analysis model in Python will be developed to identify which factors most significantly impact solar energy costs, providing insights for industry and policy decisions.

Model-agnostic permutation feature importance to analyze solar PV technoeconomic factors. Focuses on solar performance, economic viability, battery optimization, investment decisions, and policy support to identify key drivers for better PV system design and sustainable energy planning.
